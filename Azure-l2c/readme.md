### This is my Azure Lab repo
Even though I'm already a DevOps Engineer, I wanna learn and master Azure cloud, I follow the learn2cloud guide, from Phase 0 to the end, without leaving out one step, even though I know it, to make sure I get as much benefit as possible.
I dedicate my Thursdays to this study.
All of the code and snippets land here.
Here a link to the website: https://learntocloud.guide/
