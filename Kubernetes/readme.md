# 🧱 Kubernetes

## ⚙️ Overview

This repository documents my journey through Kubernetes — Here I have a lot of unfinished Tasks, or small projects I do. The real work starts in my Homelab. 
**Core Focus Areas:**
- Understanding Kubernetes architecture
- Deploying and managing Pods, Services, and Ingress
- Working with ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Volumes
- Automating with YAML, Helm, and CI/CD
- Exploring scaling, RBAC, and observability
