# Bash-Automation-DevOps

A curated collection of Bash work: from fundamentals to real-world automation.  
This repo shows my journey learning to **think in Linux** and to build small, composable scripts that solve real problems.

### What lives where?

- Bash-Kurs  
  Fundamentals: parameters, arrays, functions, I/O, exit codes, traps, etc. Great for reviewing basics.

- Bash-practices  
    In my 1 year internship, I had some practices to learn Bash Scripting (log rotation, backups, ETL-like tasks, service checks).

- Projects  
  “Shippable” scripts with README/usage/error handling. Often include config and test data.

- BashLab  
  Here I use Chatgpt to give me tasks and I gotta solve them on my own, to stay fluid and learn Shell Scripting

## 🚀 Quick Start

    # 1) Clone
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Bash-Automation-DevOps.git
    cd Bash-Automation-DevOps

    # 2) Run any script (example)
    chmod +x Projects/<some-script>.sh
    ./Projects/<some-script>.sh

    # 3) Arguments & help
    ./Projects/<some-script>.sh --help

> Scripts are POSIX-leaning **Bash**. Prefer `bash` (not `sh`) unless noted.

## 🤝 Contributing

- Keep scripts self-contained and documented (`--help`).  
- Add examples in the script header or a local README.  
- Include test data where relevant (`/data` subfolder).
