# End-to-End DevOps Project: Pacman App

## About This Project

This project involved running a 'Pacman' web application locally, through running a nodejs and mongodb container, for storing the high scores.

## Key Technical Implementations

* **Containerization:**
    * Wrote a multi-stage **Dockerfile** for the application.
    * Created a **`docker-compose.yaml`** to run the app and a **MongoDB** database locally for testing.

I am currently working on a bigger project, using this as the basis but including CI/CD, Kubernetes and Iac.
## Technologies Used

* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
