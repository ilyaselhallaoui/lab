# 1. Variables / Types



# Challenge 1 - Variables

# Python has a bunch of pre-made, built-in tools which you can use to perform task.
# One is these tools is the input() function which allows us to retrieve a user input.
# You can see these here, including the input() function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp

# Read about the input() function, try out the example to see how it works, and then only proceed.

# For this challenge, use this input function to ask “What is your favorite color?”.
# Save the response into a variable named my_input.
# Then print “Your favorite color is my_input”.
# So if I type red as my favorite color, it will print “Your favorite color is red”.

# WORK OUT YOUR SOLUTION HERE
print("What's your favourite color?")
color=input()
print("Your favourite color is " + color)
